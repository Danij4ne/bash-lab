# Neovim
# - Modern version of Vim: faster, extensible, and with better plugin support.
# - Ideal for programmers: advanced autocompletion, LSP (Python, JS, etc.).
# - Requires installation. Compatible with most Vim configurations.
# - Widely used in professional environments for its speed and customization.

# Emacs
# - Very old editor but extremely powerful and highly extensible.
# - Based on Emacs Lisp: you can turn it into almost anything (IDE, note manager, email client, etc.).
# - Less focused on raw speed than Vim/Neovim, but offers a more “complete ecosystem.”
# - Has a steep learning curve, but is extremely flexible.
