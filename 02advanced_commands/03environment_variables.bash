name="Dani"    # I create a variable called name (it will only be known in the session where it is created)

$              # used to access variables

echo $name     # it will print Dani

### Plus

.bash_profile  # this hidden file runs automatically when you start a Bash session

export Name="Dani"   # you add this line to permanently save a variable

# in every new session you open, if you call Name it will return Dani
